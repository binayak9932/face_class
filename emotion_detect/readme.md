# Face Emotion Analyzer

This repository contains a Face Emotion Analyzer that can be used to analyze emotions in facial images using Python and Flask.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Face Emotion Analyzer on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install Flask deepface opencv-python
Running the Flask Server
To start the Flask server, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Sending an Image for Analysis
You can send an image to the server for emotion analysis using PowerShell. Use the following PowerShell commands as an example:

powershell
Copy code
# Send an image for analysis
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze -Method POST -Form @{file = Get-Item "C:\path\to\your\image.jpg"}

# Retrieve the JSON response
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/analyze -Method POST -Form @{file = Get-Item "C:\path\to\your\image.jpg"}
$response.Content
Handling JSON Response
If your Flask API returns JSON data, you can handle it in PowerShell as an object for easier access to specific properties. Here's how to convert the JSON content to a PowerShell object using ConvertFrom-Json:

powershell
Copy code
# Convert JSON response to a PowerShell object
$jsonResponse = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
$jsonResponse
JSON Data Returned by Your Flask API
The JSON data returned by your Flask API will contain information about the emotions detected in the input image. You can access this information using the PowerShell object created from the JSON response.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this README to provide more details about your project and how users can interact with it. Good luck with your Face Emotion Analyzer project!
